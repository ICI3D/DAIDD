> How does dynamical fever work?

It's an implementation of a very simple model world

* One infection is introduced from outside at the beginning of the year
* Humans do not transmit
* Dogs transmit equally to dogs and to humans
	* â€¦ with the _minimum_ amount of stochasticity consistent with the fact that individuals are individuals
	* everyone mixes equally
* Surveillance is perfect
* Recovered dogs and humans are immune for several months
	* We assume that they lose immunity after the end of the epidemic and before next year's
* The vaccine works perfectly
	* and the vaccination program!

__That's all there is!__
