In this tutorial, we will fit a series of models, with different model structures, to HIV prevalence data from antenatal clinics (ANC data). 

* You will be provided with a series of models, which increase in complexity. 
* At each step you will be able to change parameter values in efforts to optimise the fit to the data. 
* Initial models may fail to give good fits to the data and you will try to decide how models might be improved. 
* You should work in small groups and discuss the model, the code, the parameters, how things work, where and why the model fails to work etc. etc. 

The idea is NOT to rush through the various models as quickly as possible: the idea is to get a good feeling about what is going on with each model.
