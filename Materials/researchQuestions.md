subtitle: Formulating Research Questions for Modeling Projects

In this exercise, we ask participants to go through a series of steps designed to help them think about their approach to research and about communicating their research to those outside their specialization.

### Step 0

-   Find a partner who is someone you haven't talked to yet.

### Step 1 (individual, 5+ minutes)

- Write down your research question in plain language. Use words that anyone could understand.

### Step 2 (individual, 5+ minutes)

- Think about the processes that will determine the answer to your research questions.
   - Do any of these processes involve dependence between individuals?
   - Are there any effects that you expect to be nonlinear - eg, where you would expect a 20% change in one variable or parameter to be associated with with a larger or smaller percent change in another variable?

### Step 3 (partner, 10+ minutes)
-   Decide which partner will go first to discuss your research.
-   State your research question, then allow them to ask you questions about your question. Discuss your question until you arrive at a common understanding of what the question is and why it's important.
-   Describe to your partner the dependent processes and nonlinearities you've identified in your system.
    - Try to convince your partner that these processes are not expected to be independent and/or linear.
    - Let your partner try to convince you otherwise, if they don't agree that these effects would occur.

### Step 4 (partner, 10+ minutes)

-   Repeat **Step 3** for the other partner's research question.

### Step 5 (individual, 5+ minutes)

-   Think about the aspects of your question that needed additional explanation for your partner to understand them and what helped you get your message across (e.g., figures/diagrams, gestures, analogies, etc).
-   Modify your research question to make it as clear as possible to a broad audience.
-   Write down your partner's research question in your own words.

### Step 6 (group)

-   Share (your version of) your partner's research question with the group. Describe any dependent processes or nonlinearities that you identified.

### Step 7 (individual)

-   Make any further adjustments to your research question that seem appropriate after hearing your partner's interpretation of your research. You can adopt their language if you feel they have done a particularly good job of wording your question so it can be understood by those outside your field of study.
-   Post the revised version of your research question on the **DAIDD2017participants** dropbox, by following the instructions:
    - write your research question and convert the document to PDF
    - name your file using the filename convention 'yourName.question.pdf'
    - make sure you're signed in using your Dropbox username and password
    - navigate to the 'researchQuestions' folder
    - copy the PDF file with your research question to the Dropbox folder
