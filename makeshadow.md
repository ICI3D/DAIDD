The schedule is currently made from [index.top](schedule/index.top) and [shadow.md]. The idea is that you edit those two files, save, and then say `make schedule/index.md` from the main folder of the pages branch.

You can compare the [shadow schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/DAIDD/schedule/shadow) and the public schedule](http://www.ici3d.org/DAIDD/schedule/test) now to get an idea of what functionality I'm trying to incorporate.

I see that you've disabled the public link to the public schedule, so I've also made a test version (updated using `make schedule/test.md`
